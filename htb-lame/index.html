This was my first time attempting a Hack The Box machine that&rsquo;s not on the Starting Point. The machine offers two modes: Adventure Mode and Guided Mode. I first went for the Adventure Mode because I wanted to explore the box and solve it on my own. However, I hit a dead end and didn&rsquo;t know how to proceed. So, I switched to Guided Mode, which was similar to the Starting Point boxes. With the help of Guided Mode and the questions, I was able to solve the box easily. Looking back, it wasn&rsquo;t really that hard, but I felt stuck and had no clude what to do next. It takes a lot of trial and error to get better at this, and I&rsquo;ve improved a lot over the past few months. I&rsquo;m proud of my progress, but I know I have a long way to go. In the end, it&rsquo;s so much fun, and that&rsquo;s what really matters."

<p>This was my first time attempting a Hack The Box machine that&rsquo;s not on the Starting Point. The machine offers two modes: <strong><em>Adventure Mode</em></strong> and <strong><em>Guided Mode</em></strong>. I first went for the Adventure Mode because I wanted to explore the box and solve it on my own. However, I hit a dead end and didn&rsquo;t know how to proceed. So, I switched to Guided Mode, which was similar to the Starting Point boxes. With the help of Guided Mode and the questions, I was able to solve the box easily. Looking back, it wasn&rsquo;t really that hard, but I felt stuck and had no clude what to do next. It takes a lot of trial and error to get better at this, and I&rsquo;ve improved a lot over the past few months. I&rsquo;m proud of my progress, but I know I have a long way to go.
