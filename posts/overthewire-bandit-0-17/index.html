<h4 id="level-4---5">Level 4 -&gt; 5</h4>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.</p>
<p><img src="image-5.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>The <code>file ./*</code> command returned that the <strong>file#7</strong> has a different file format from the rest of the files. The <strong><em>ASCII text</em></strong> is also a human-readable file format.</p>
<p><strong><em>password</em></strong>: <code>4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw</code></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="level-5---6">Level 5 -&gt; 6</h4>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>human-readable</li>
<li>1033 bytes in size</li>
<li>not executable</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="image-6.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-7.png#center" alt="alt text">
The reason I appended <strong>&lsquo;c&rsquo;</strong> after 1033 could be found under the <strong>find</strong>&rsquo;s <strong>man</strong> page.</p>
<br>
<p><strong><em>password</em></strong>: <code>HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG</code></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="level-6---7">Level 6 -&gt; 7</h4>
<p>The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>owned by user bandit7</li>
<li>owned by group bandit6</li>
<li>33 bytes in size</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="image-8.png#center" alt="alt text">
There wasn&rsquo;t any directory or file inside the <strong>bandit6</strong> directory.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-9.png#center" alt="alt text">
So I moved up a directory and run the following command: <code>find /home/ -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c</code>. The command returned some outputs but I did not have a permission to access any of them. So I decided to navigate to the parent directory of the current working directory once again.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-10.png#center" alt="alt text">
The code returned too many outputs that I did not want to waste my time reading one by one to find the answer so I appended the following code to only return ones without errors. <code>2&gt;/dev/null</code>.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-11.png#center" alt="alt text">
Got the password!</p>

<h4 id="level-7---8">Level 7 -&gt; 8</h4>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth</p>

<h4 id="level-11---12">Level 11 -&gt; 12</h4>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.</p>
<p><img src="image-19.png#center" alt="alt text">
We have to first understand what <strong>ROT13</strong> is before we solve this question. According to the <strong><em>Wikipedia</em></strong>, <strong>ROT13</strong> is a simple letter subsitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the Latin alphabet.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-20.png#center" alt="alt text">
<code>tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'</code>: This command tells <strong>tr</strong> to replace each letter in the first set (<code>A-Za-z</code>) with the corresponding letter in the second set (<code>N-ZA-Mn-za-m</code>), effectively rotating the alphabet by 13 positions.</p>
<br>

<h4 id="level-12---13">Level 12 -&gt; 13</h4>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)</p>
<p><img src="image-21.png#center" alt="alt text">
While researching about this question, I kept encountering the command <code>xxd</code> and I learned the following:
The <code>xxd</code> command in linux is a powerful utility for creating a hexadecimal (<strong>hex</strong>) dump of a given file. <strong><em>It also allows you to reverse the operation, converting a hex dump back into the original binary form</em></strong>.</p>
<br>
<p><code>-r</code> is the Reverse operation.</p>
<p><img src="image-22.png#center" alt="alt text">
<strong><em>Permission denied</em></strong> because the guest user <strong>bandit12</strong> does not have the permission to <strong>write</strong> in the current directory.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-23.png#center" alt="alt text">
as suggested in the question, I will create the original file inside the <strong>tmp</strong> file since anyone can write inside the file.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-24.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<p><img src="image-25.png#center" alt="alt text">
Decompressed the hexdump file and it&rsquo;s now <strong>gzip</strong> compressed data. I renamed the file as <code>convert_back.gz</code> and decompressed it with the following command: <code>gunzip convert_back.gz</code>.</p>
<p>It now became a <code>bzip2</code> compressed data.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-26.png#center" alt="alt text">
decompressed back the file using <code>bunzip2</code> command and once again it&rsquo;s a <strong>gzip</strong> file.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-27.png#center" alt="alt text">
To decompress and extract the contents of a <strong>POSIX tar archive file</strong>, you can use the <code>tar</code> command.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-28.png#center" alt="alt text">
From there the process of decompressing files continued until the file format turned out to be <strong>ASCII text</strong>.</p>
<br>

<hr>
<h4 id="level-13---14">Level 13 -&gt; 14</h4>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on</p>
<p><img src="image-29.png#center" alt="alt text">
Inside the <strong>bandit13</strong> directory, there was this <strong><em>ssh private key</em></strong>. As stated in the question, there is no password inside this directory but this private file. We have to figure a way to login as <strong>bandit14</strong> using the private key.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-30.png#center" alt="alt text">
I logged out of the ssh server and downloaded the private key from the ssh server to the localhost using the <code>scp</code> command.</p>
<p><code>scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:/home/bandit13/sshkey.private ~/Desktop</code></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-31.png#center" alt="alt text">
<code>man ssh</code> shows that we can utilize the <code>-i</code> option when logging into the ssh server using a private key without password.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-32.png#center" alt="alt text">
Logging into the SSH server failed because the file permissions were too open. <strong><em>It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.</em></strong></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-33.png#center" alt="alt text">
<code>chmod 700 sshkey.private</code></p>
<p>I made the file only accessible by the user using the <code>chmod 700</code> command above and succeeded in logging into the server.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-34.png#center" alt="alt text">
As written in the question, the password was located in the following path, <strong>/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14</strong> and it was only accessible by user <strong>bandit14</strong>. Since I logged in as bandit14, I could obtain the password.</p>
<br>
<p><strong><em>password</em></strong>: <code>MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS</code></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="level-14---15">Level 14 -&gt; 15</h4>
<p>The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.</p>
<p><img src="image-35.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p><strong><em>password</em></strong>: <code>8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo</code></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="level-15---16">Level 15 -&gt; 16</h4>
<p>The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.</p>
<p>Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.</p>
<p><code>openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>openssl</code>: OpenSSL is widely used for implementing SSL/TLS protocols and managing certificates, keys, and other cryptographic operations.</li>
<li><code>s_client</code>: This a subcommand within <strong><em>opnessl</em></strong> that allows you to connect to a remote server over <strong>SSL/TLS</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you run the full command, it initiates an SSL/TLS handshake with the server at <strong>localhost</strong> on port <strong>30001</strong>. Once the connection is established, <strong>openssl s_client</strong> will display various details about the connection, including the server&rsquo;s certificate, the cipher being used, and other SSL/TLS parameters.</p>
<p><img src="image-36.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<p><strong><em>password</em></strong>: <code>kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx</code></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="level-16---17">Level 16 -&gt; 17</h4>
<p>The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.</p>
<p><img src="image-37.png#center" alt="alt text">
I used <strong><em>nmap</em></strong> to scan open ports in the range 31000 to 32000 on localhost and found 5 open ports. However, if you look closely under the port <strong>31790</strong>, it writes <strong>Wrong! Please enter the correct current password.</strong> implying a high possibility that it is the port that we are looking for.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-38.png#center" alt="alt text">
<code>openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790</code></p>
<p>I typed the correct password but it kept returning <strong>KEYUPDATE</strong>.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-43.png#center" alt="alt text">
<code>openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -ign_eof</code></p>
<p>The <code>KEYUPDATE</code> output was returned before because the <strong><em>KeyUpdate</em></strong> operation is traggered via <code>K</code>/<code>k</code> and the password included a <code>K</code>. You can switch off the interactive commands using the <code>-ign_eof</code> option. After correcting the command, I was able to obtain the RSA Private Key.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-44.png#center" alt="alt text">
navigated to the <strong>/tmp</strong> directory because I don&rsquo;t have the permission to create a file in the current working directory. Created a new file called <strong><em>ssh.private</em></strong> using <code>vim</code>.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-45.png#center" alt="alt text">
Transferred the file from the SSH server to my local machine using the <code>scp</code> command.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-46.png#center" alt="alt text">
change the file permissions so the user can only have access to the file.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-47.png#center" alt="alt text">
logged into the SSH server using the private key file instead of password.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-48.png#center" alt="alt text">
I know I could use the private key to log in but I grabbed the password to bandit17 that&rsquo;s located in the following path just in case: <code>/etc/bandit_pass/bandit17</code></p>
