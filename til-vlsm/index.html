Until now, I have practiced subnetting used FLSM (Fixed-Length Subnet Masks). This means that all of the subnets use the same prefix length (ie. subnetting a Class C network into 4 subnets using /26).
VLSM (Variable-Length Subnet Masks) is the process of creating subnets of different sizes, to make your use of network addresses more efficient.


Here&rsquo;s an example of a small enterprise network. There are two LANs in Tokyo and two LANs in Toronto. We are assigned the 192.168.1.0/24 network and must divide it into 5 subnets to provide IP addresses for all hosts in the enterprise network."

<p>Until now, I have practiced subnetting used FLSM (Fixed-Length Subnet Masks). This means that all of the subnets use the same prefix length (ie. subnetting a Class C network into 4 subnets using /26).</p>
<p>VLSM (Variable-Length Subnet Masks) is the process of creating subnets of different sizes, to make your use of network addresses more efficient.</p>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="./image-34.png"></div>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a small enterprise network. There are two LANs in Tokyo and two LANs in Toronto. We are assigned the <code>192.168.1.0/24</code> network and must divide it into 5 subnets to provide IP addresses for all hosts in the enterprise network.</p>
<p>If we were to try this with FLSM (Fixed-length subnet masks), we would need to borrow 3 bits to make enough subnets. That would leave 5 host bits left. 5 host bits only allow 30 host addresses, so that&rsquo;s not enough addresses for Tokyo LAN A and Toronto LAN B.</p>
<p>However, if we use VLSM we can assign different subnet sizes to each LAN, which will allow us to make sure each LAN has enough addresses available.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="steps-to-subnet-using-vlsm">Steps to subnet using VLSM</h3>
<ol>
<li>Assign the largest subnet at the start of the address space.</li>
<li>Assign the second-largest subnet after it.</li>
<li>Repeat the process until all subnets have been assigned.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we look at our network above, we will assign subnets in this following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tokyo LAN A</li>
<li>Toronto LAN B</li>
<li>Toronto LAN A</li>
<li>Tokyo LAN B</li>
<li>point-to-point connection</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3 id="tokyo-lan-a">Tokyo LAN A</h3>
<p>Because we need to accommodate 110 hosts for Tokyo LAN A, we have to have at least 7 host bits, which leads to /25 prefix length.</p>
<p>Convert the original address to binary bits</p>

<br>
<h3 id="toronto-lan-b">Toronto LAN B</h3>
<p>We have our first subnet, 192.168.1.0/25 for Tokyo LAN A. The network address of Toronto LAN B should be 192.168.1.128, just 1 up Tokyo LAN A&rsquo;s broadcast address. However, we have to calculate what prefix length we should use for Toronto LAN B.</p>
<p>Because Toronto LAN B has to have 45 hosts, that means we have to have 6 host bits. That means, the prefix length of the subnet is going to be /26.</p>

Total number of usable host addresses: 2^6 - 2 = 62</code></pre>
<br>
<h3 id="toronto-lan-a">Toronto LAN A</h3>
<p>Next is subnetting Toronto LAN A. The broadcast address of the previous subnet, Toronto LAN B, is 192.168.1.191/26. So, the network address of Toronto LAN A is 192.168.1.192, we just need to figure out the prefix length.</p>
<p>Since we need to accommodate 29 hosts, we need to have 5 host bits. 2 ^ 5 - 2 = 30, which means the prefix length of the subnet is going to be /27.</p>

<h3 id="tokyo-lan-b">Tokyo LAN B</h3>
<p>The broadcast address of Toronto LAN A is 192.168.1.223/27. To get the network address of Tokyo LAN B, we just need to add 1 to it. 192.168.1.224. Tokyo LAN B needs to have 8 hosts, which means 4 host bits are needed. The prefix length is /28.</p>

<br>
<h3 id="point-to-point-connection">Point-to-point connection</h3>
<p>The broadcast address of Tokyo LAN B is 192.168.1.239. Therefore, the network address of point-to-point connection is 192.168.1.240. Since this is a point-to-point connection, we only need to accommodate 2 hosts. Two answers are possible for this, the first choice is /31 prefix length. However, for the CCNA test, if you are asked what prefix length to use for a subnet that requires two hosts, it is recommended not using a /31 prefix length.</p>
<p>Then, our other option is /30 prefix length because we need 2 host bits. (2 ^ 2 - 2 = 2).</p>

Notice that each subnet uses a different prefix length. If we tried to use the same prefix length for each subnet, there wouldn't be enough address space.

<p>The subnet with the second biggest hosts is LAN 1.
