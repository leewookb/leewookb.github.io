<p>This box was easier compared to the previous two I attempted. However, I still referred to the provided walkthrough. I am trying to apply a <code>top-down</code> approach to my learning as a mentor advised me to. I feel too dependent on resources because I am not confident in my skills yet and have always relied on guided learning. I admit there is not shortcut; <code>trial and error</code> will benefit me in the long run.</p>

<p>When I was studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification, the CIA triad was emphasized repeatedly throughout the course. I&rsquo;m grateful for this question as it reminds me again of this important cybersecurity principle.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>2.289.1</code></pre>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t determine the Jenkins version from the nmap scan results. The hint suggested checking the bottom right corner of the <code>admin</code> page, implying I needed admin access. I didn&rsquo;t know the admin credentials, but the walkthrough recommended searching for common weak credential pairs. The combination that worked was <code>root:password</code>.</p>

<h4 id="what-would-the-string-cmd-variable-from-the-groovy-script-snippet-be-equal-to-if-the-target-vm-was-running-windows">What would the <code>String cmd</code> variable from the Groovy Script snippet be equal to if the Target VM was running Windows?</h4>






<pre tabindex="0"><code>cmd.exe</code></pre>
<p>I thought having access to a script console implies we need to create a reverse shell, meaning the target will initiate a connection back to our attacker VM. I referred to the Java version of the Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet because the Groovy script uses Java syntax. The Java Alternative 1 option shows that <code>String cmd</code> variable is equal to <code>cmd.exe</code> in Windows.</p>

<p>Since the target was linux based, I had to change the <code>String cmd=&quot;cmd.exe&quot;</code> to <code>String cmd=&quot;/bin/bash&quot;</code>. Before sending the payload, I started netcat to receive the reverse shell using the command: <code>nc -lvnp 1234</code>. I personally specified the port 1234 in the payload, and netcat was set to listen on that port.</p>
<p>After sucessfully receiving the reverse shell, I was able to locate the flag on the target host.</p>
