  content="A major event happened in my life over the past 2 months, which is why I haven&rsquo;t been able to keep up with posting write-ups on my blog. But just because I haven&rsquo;t written anything for a while doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that I haven&rsquo;t been studying. On a positive note, I got a job as a Cybersecurity specialist! While my current role doesn&rsquo;t involve pentesting, which is a bit of bummer, It&rsquo;s still an amazing opportunity to expand my skills and expertise in this field that I love. I already have learned a ton and I am excited to keep growing and hopefully get involved in pentesting in the near future."

    <p>A major event happened in my life over the past 2 months, which is why I haven&rsquo;t been able to keep up with posting write-ups on my blog. But just because I haven&rsquo;t written anything for a while doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that I haven&rsquo;t been studying. On a positive note, I got a job as a Cybersecurity specialist! While my current role doesn&rsquo;t involve pentesting, which is a bit of bummer, It&rsquo;s still an amazing opportunity to expand my skills and expertise in this field that I love.

<h3 id="lab-remote-code-execution-via-web-shell-upload">Lab: Remote code execution via web shell upload</h3>
<p>This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn&rsquo;t perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server&rsquo;s file system.</p>
<p>To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the content of the file <code>/home/carlos/secret</code>. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.</p>
<p>You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: <code>wiener:peter</code></p>
<hr>
<p><img src="image.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>This is the main page of the Lab</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-1.png#center" alt="alt text">
If we click on <code>view post</code>, we can see we have a functionality to upload files at the bottom of the page</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-2.png#center" alt="alt text">
Or if we click on <code>My account</code> and login with the provided credentials <code>wiener:peter</code>, upload functionality is also available there.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-8.png#center" alt="alt text">
First, I chose a cat image file that was available from my Desktop and toggled <code>Intercept on</code> button on Burp Suite to intercept the traffic. Then, uploaded the file.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-9.png#center" alt="alt text">
This is the content of the POST request we just made to upload the cat image file. If you look closely, it specifies the <code>name</code>, <code>filename</code>, <code>Content-Type</code> of the uploaded file and also the random texts below are actually what make up the image file.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-10.png#center" alt="alt text">
We get this confirmation message saying that our file is uploaded to the following path <code>avatars/{filename}</code></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-11.png#center" alt="alt text">
After clicking on <code>Back to My Account</code>, we can see that the uploaded cat image is set as  our avatar image.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-12.png#center" alt="alt text">
I sent the POST request I made earlier to Repeater and changed the <code>filename</code> to <strong>exploit.php</strong> and deleted the texts below and replaced them with the php webshell code.</p>






<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#cdd6f4;background-color:#1e1e2e;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span style="display:flex;"><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f849c">1</span><span><span style="color:#89dceb;font-weight:bold">&lt;?</span>php <span style="color:#cba6f7">echo</span> file_get_contents(<span style="color:#a6e3a1">&#39;/etc/passwd&#39;</span>); <span style="color:#6c7086;font-style:italic">?&gt;</span><span style="color:#f38ba8">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<br>
<p><img src="image-13.png#center" alt="alt text">
This is the GET request to retrieve the previously uploded image file. I replaced the image file name with <code>exploit.php</code> because it&rsquo;s the name of the webshell file we just replaced the image file with.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-14.png#center" alt="alt text">
If you look on the right side of the screenshot, we successfully retrieved <code>/etc/passwd</code></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-15.png#center" alt="alt text">
Now, all we have to do is replace <code>/etc/passwd</code> with <code>/home/carlos/secret</code> because that&rsquo;s the path where the answer to the question is located. It&rsquo;s specified in the question.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-16.png#center" alt="alt text">
The server responded with the secret <code>E7GnNlW2W2SAasyDLDzzHeCsKYNJ8nNk</code></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-17.png#center" alt="alt text">
I submitted the returned string as the answer</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-18.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
