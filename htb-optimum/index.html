This machine was pretty straightforward and much easier than I expected it to be. I truly feel like I have improved a lot in the past 2-3 weeks because 2 weeks ago, I definitely would&rsquo;ve not been able to solve this machine by myself. I still have a lot of room to develop, and I found myself freezing and getting lost when it came to the privilege escalation stage. I definitely need to spend more time working on it. Still, I think I deserve to be proud of myself for tackling this machine (almost) entirely on my own."

<p>This machine was pretty straightforward and much easier than I expected it to be. I truly feel like I have improved a lot in the past 2-3 weeks because 2 weeks ago, I definitely would&rsquo;ve not been able to solve this machine by myself. I still have a lot of room to develop, and I found myself freezing and getting lost when it came to the <strong><em>privilege escalation</em></strong> stage. I definitely need to spend more time working on it. Still, I think I deserve to be proud of myself for tackling this machine (almost) entirely on my own.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="image.png#center" alt="alt text">
nmap scan showed that only 1 port open, which is the port 80 with the version of <strong><em>HttpFileServer httpd 2.3</em></strong></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-1.png#center" alt="alt text">
navigated to the web of target ip address <strong><em>10.10.10.8</em></strong>.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-2.png#center" alt="alt text">
couldn&rsquo;t find anything juicy excpet when I clicked on the <strong><em>login</em></strong> button there was this pop-up asking for credentials.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-3.png#center" alt="alt text">
I searched on <strong><em>searchsploit</em></strong> to see if there is an exploit for <strong><em>Httpfileserver 2.3</em></strong> that I found through an nmap scan and there was one exploit titled <strong><em>Rejetto HttpFileserver 2.3.x - Remote Command Execution</em></strong>. RCE attack is exactly what I was hoping for.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-4.png#center" alt="alt text">
Since I knew there exists an exploit for the version that&rsquo;s running on the server, I moved on to <strong><em>metasploit</em></strong></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-5.png#center" alt="alt text">
on the options page of the exploit, configured every required option including <strong>RHOSTS</strong>, <strong>RPORT</strong>, <strong>SRVHOST</strong>, <strong>SRVPORT</strong>, <strong>LHOST</strong>, and <strong>LPORT</strong>.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-6.png#center" alt="alt text">
successfully executed the exploit and gained access to the user shell.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-7.png#center" alt="alt text">
obtained the user flag.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-8.png#center" alt="alt text">
However with the current user privilege, I could not access the root user directory. It was time for privilege escalation to move up vertically.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-9.png#center" alt="alt text">
As I learned from the previous machines, searched for a <code>post/multi/recon</code> module and it returned 4 modules. The second module is the one I&rsquo;ve used before on a machine which explores the current compromised local session and suggests all the potential exploits.</p>
<p>The <strong>post/multi/recon</strong> represents a category of post-exploitation modules designed to perform reconnaissance tasks on compromised systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>post</em></strong>: short for <strong><em>post-exploitation</em></strong>. These modules are used after gaining access to a target system. They help gather additional information or achieve specific tasks once the initial compromise has been made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>multi</em></strong>: indicates that the module is applicable to multiple platforms or operating systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>recon</em></strong>: short for <strong><em>reconnaissance</em></strong>, these modules are used to collect information about the target system or network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><img src="image-10.png#center" alt="alt text">
As you could see the module requires me to list a session I would like to use the exploit on. In my case, I listed the session that I previously obtained which had id 2.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-11.png#center" alt="alt text">
It outputted all the possible exploits I could run on the current backgrouned session and what I decided to use was named <code>exploit/windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc</code>. As you could notice from its name, it is used for a <strong><em>privilege escalation</em></strong> exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-12.png#center" alt="alt text">
successfully executed the exploit and gained the root shell! as you could see the <code>getuid</code> command returned <code>NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM</code>, another name for root!</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-13.png#center" alt="alt text">
Got the root flag :)</p>
