<h3 id="lab-web-shell-upload-via-content-type-restriction-bypass">Lab: Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass</h3>
<p>this lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this. To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file <code>/home/carlos/secret</code>. Submit the secret using the button provided in the lab banner. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: <code>wiener:peter</code></p>

<p>Just like the previous lab, I uploaded an arbitrary cat image file for Burp Suite to intercept the request.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-1.png#center" alt="alt text">
As you can see from the screenshot above, it specifies the <code>name</code>, <code>filename</code>, <code>Content-Type</code>, and many more information of the file we are trying to upload.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-2.png#center" alt="alt text">
I replaced the <code>filename</code> to <strong>exploit.php</strong>, <code>Content-Type</code> to <strong>application/x-php</strong>, and the whole PNG strings with the php webshell code.</p>






<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#cdd6f4;background-color:#1e1e2e;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span style="display:flex;"><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f849c">1</span><span><span style="color:#89dceb;font-weight:bold">&lt;?</span>php <span style="color:#cba6f7">echo</span> file_get_contents(<span style="color:#a6e3a1">&#39;/home/carlos/secret&#39;</span>); <span style="color:#6c7086;font-style:italic">?&gt;</span><span style="color:#f38ba8">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<br>
<p><img src="image-3.png#center" alt="alt text">
This is the respond I got from the request with replaced values.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry, file type application/x-php is not allowed only image/jpeg and image/png are allowed</strong></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-4.png#center" alt="alt text">
This is a pretty easy fix, all I had to do was replace the <code>Content-Type</code> value back with <strong>image/png</strong></p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-5.png#center" alt="alt text">
Tada! we got the status code 200 and message saying the file has been successfully uploaded.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-6.png#center" alt="alt text">
When I went back to the account page, I saw this broken image icon just right above the Upload button.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-7.png#center" alt="alt text">
Right click on it and select <strong>Open image in new tab</strong>, and we are prompted with the secret message that we were looking for. Also, notice the URL is the path where our uploaded file is stored in.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-8.png#center" alt="alt text">
Click on the <strong>Submit solution</strong> button and entered our secret message.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="image-9.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Lab solved!</p>
