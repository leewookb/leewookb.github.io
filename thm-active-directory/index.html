    <p>Microsoft&rsquo;s <strong><em>Active Directory</em></strong> is the backbone of the corporate world. It simplifies the management of devices and users within a corporate environment.</p>
<p><code>Windows domain</code> is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business. The main idea behind a domain is to centralize the administration of common components of a Windows computer network in a sigle repository called <code>Active Directory</code>. The server that runs the Active Directory service is known as a <code>Domain Controller (DC)</code>.</p>
<p>The main advantages of having a configured Windows domain are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Centralized identity management</em></strong>: All users across the network can be configured from Active Directory with minimum effort.</li>
<li><strong><em>Managing security policies</em></strong>: You can configure security policies directly from Active Directory and apply them to users and computers across the network as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-real-world-example">A Real-World Example</h4>
<p>In school/university networks, you will often be provided with a username and password that you can use on any of the computers available on campus. Your credentials are valid for all machines because whenever you input them on a machine, it will forward the authentication process back to the Active Directory, where you credentials will be checked. Thanks to Active Directory, your credentials don&rsquo;t need to exist in each machine and are available throughout the network.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>Domain Controller</code></pre>
<br>
<p>The core of any Windows Domain is the <strong><em>Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS)</em></strong>. This service acts as a catalogue that holds the information of all the &ldquo;objects&rdquo; that exist on your network. Amongst the many objects supported by AD, we have users, groups, machines, printers, shares, and many others.</p>
<p><img src="image.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<br>
<h4 id="security-groups-vs-ous-orgianizational-units">Security Groups vs OUs (Orgianizational Units)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>OUs</em></strong> are handy for applying policies to users and computers, which include specific configurations that pertain to sets of users depending on their particular role in the enterprise. Remember, a user can only be a member of a single OU at a time, as it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to try to apply two different policies to a single user.</li>
<li><strong><em>Security Groups</em></strong>, on the other hand, are used to grant permissions over resources. For example, you will use groups if you want to allow some users to access a shared folder or network printer. A user can be a part of many groups, which is needed to grant access to multiple resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the nice things you can do in AD is to give specific users some control over some OUs. This process is known as <strong><em>delegation</em></strong> and allows you to grant users specific privileges to perform advanced tasks on OUs without needing a Domain Administrator to step in.</p>
<p>One of the most common use cases for this is granting <strong><em>IT Support</em></strong> the privileges to reset othe low-privilege users&rsquo; passwords.</p>
<br>
<p>I delegated our IT support (phillip) the rights to reset other people&rsquo;s passwords. Then I logged in as phillip then changed Sophie&rsquo;s passwords by running the following command:</p>
<p><code>Set-ADAccountPassword sophie -Reset -NewPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt 'New Password') - Verbose</code></p>

<p>To deploy different policies for each OU individually Windows use <strong><em>Group Policy Objects (GPO)</em></strong>. GPOs are simply a collection of settings that can be applied to OUs. GPOs can contain policies aimed at either users or computers, allowing you to set a baseline on specific machines and identities.</p>

<p>GPOs are distributed to the network via a network share called <code>SYSVOL</code>, which is stored in the DC. All users in a domain should typically have access to this share over the network to sync their GPOs periodically.</p>

<p>When using Windows domains, all credentials are stored in the <code>Domain Controllers</code>. Whenever a user tries to authenticate to a service using domain credentials, the service will need to ask the Domain Controller to verify if they are correct. Two protocols can be used for network authentication in windows domains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Kerberos</em></strong>: used by any recent version of Windows. This is the default protocol in any recent domain.</li>
<li><strong><em>NetNTLM</em></strong>: Legacy authentication protocol kept for compatibility purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="kerberos-authentication">Kerberos Authentication</h4>
<p>Kerberos authentication is the default authentication protocol for any recent version of Windows. users who log into a service using Kerberos will be assigned tickets. Think of tickets as proof of a previous authentication. users with tickets can present them to a service to demonstrate they have already authenticated into the network before and are therefore enabled to use it.</p>
<p>When <code>Kerberos</code> is used for authentication, the following process happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user sends their encrypted credentials to the <code>Key Distribution Center (KDC)</code> in charge of creating Kerberos tickets on the network. The KDC will create and send back a <code>Ticket Granting Ticket</code>, which will allow the user to request additional tickets to access specific services. <code>TGT</code> is encrypted using the <code>krbgt</code> account&rsquo;s password hash and therefore the user can&rsquo;t access its contents.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="image-6.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>When a user wants to connect to a service on the network, they will use their TGT to ask the KDC for a <code>Ticket Granting Service (TGS)</code>.
TGS are tickets that allow connection only to the specific service they were created for. To request a TGS, the user will send their credentials encrypted using the Session Key, along with the TGT and a <code>Service Principal Name (SPN)</code>, which indicates the service and server name we intend to access.</p>
<p>As a result, the KDC will send us a TGS along with a <code>Service Session Key</code>, which we will need to authenticate to the service we want to access. The TGS is encrypted using a key derived from the <code>Service Owner Hash</code>.</p>
<p><img src="image-7.png#center" alt="alt text"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TGS can then be sent to the desired service to authenticate and establish a connection. The service will use its configured account&rsquo;s password hash to decrypt the TGS and validate the Service Session Key.
