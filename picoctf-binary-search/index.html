Description
Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You&rsquo;ll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.
Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics. Practicing the fundamentals manually might help you in the future when you have to write your own tools!"

<p>This one was fairly easy because I was already familiar with the Binary Search Algorithm.
Majoring in Computer Science finally paid off.. ðŸ˜­</p>
